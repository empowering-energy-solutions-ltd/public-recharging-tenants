# Introduction - Recharging tenants

Background:

Many large comercial and public-sector sites can have on-site tenants such as shops, residential tenants & parts of the business that require individual energy billing. Recharging tenants can be used by site energy managers to recharge such tenants using their submeters and the overall site energy invoices.

Recharging tenants allows sites to:
- Recharge tenants for their energy consumption.
- Apply fixed charges for their use of site systems.
- Create a seperate spreadsheet for both commercial and residential tenants.
